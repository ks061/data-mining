## Basic Information

Name: Kartikeya Sharma  
Class: CSCI 349 - Intro to Data Mining  
Semester: 2021SP  
Instructor: Brian King 

## About Me

I am Kartikeya Sharma, a third-year undergraduate
student at Bucknell University, pursuing a
major in Computer Science & Engineering and a
minor in Economics. I am also currently 
engaged in undergraduate research at Bucknell
University within the Department of Computer
Science under the guidance of Professor Brian
R. King in the realm of data mining and 
machine learning, designing software applying
a unique blend of tools from the aforementioned
fields to ultimately be used for research in
the field of autism spectrum disorder. 

(Note: I limited my response to a few sentences
because the prompt asked to 'state' who I am.)

## About the Course: Intro to Data Mining

This course focuses on data mining, an 
upper-level elective called "Intro to
Data Mining" and identified by CSCI 349
within the course catalog of the 
Department of Computer Science at
Bucknell University, and is being
taught by Professor Brian R. King in the
spring semester of 2021. In a very brief
sense, the course covers methods for 
preparing data for analysis and
various methods for extracting patterns
and creating visualizations for the data.

#### _Course Objectives_
_The following list identifies the primary 
objectives of the course. This course aims to 
teach students how to:_
1. _Understand the breadth of opportunities in this 
   burgeoning field; understand the logic behind 
   the increased interest in data mining in 
   numerous domains_
2. _Learn essential terminology to be able to speak
   intelligently about data mining and data
   science_
3. _Learn foundational material in statistics and 
   probability that is critical to understanding
   methods discussed_
4. _Understand how real-world entities are 
   represented in data_
5. _Explore the most common tasks faced by data 
   miners for understanding patterns in data, 
   including classification, discrimination, 
   association, and cluster analysis_
6. _Explain common challenges that are faced when 
   dealing with "big data", including filtering and 
   cleaning of large data sets, data analysis, 
   storage and retrieval, and explore how these
   challenges are met_
7. _Learn how to use real-world data mining software 
   to explore large datasets_
8. _Gain experience in data mining by applying 
   methods learned using a current, popular data
   mining framework, working through numerous labs,
   assignments and a final project_
   
#### _Topics_
_We will explore fundamental methods used in data 
mining. Topics will include:_
- _Background and history of data mining_
- _Definitions, and use of the methods today_
- _Essential statistics and probability_
- _Data munging / wrangling - preprocessing and 
  cleaning_
- _Mining frequent patterns / association analysis_
- _Classification models_
- _Clustering_
- _(Time permitting) Advanced classification 
  models, outlier detection, stream and sequence
  mining, biological data, other advanced topics_

## My Skills

My technical skills specific to the field 
of computer science include academic experience
in Data Strucutres & Algorithms, Computer
Organization, Design & Analysis of Algorithms,
and Operating Systems Design, 
proficiency in programming across multiple 
languages, mathematics, and software engineering.
<sup>1</sup> I have experience in the
programming languages Python, Java, and C, as
well as the markup languages HTML and CSS.
I have used PHP and MySQL and have been
exposed to JavaScript. I have proficiency in
the fundamentals of calculus, linear algebra, 
differential equations, and discrete
mathematics. With regards to software
engineering, I have experience with UML diagrams,
unit testing, SCRUM, design
patterns, UI design, code documentation,
and developing an RPG game.

I also have skills in project collaboration,
project or organizational leadership,
organization, and attention to detail.

## Post-Graduate Plans

After graduation, my goal is to go pursue a graduate degree in 
computer science within the realm of machine learning and/or data
science. I also hope to apply neural networks and natural language
processing to the field of mental health in hopes of making aspects
of mental health services more accessible for the general population;
the feasibility of this goal would need to be evaluated as I proceed 
with graduate school and beyond, that is, over time.
