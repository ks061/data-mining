Within those two thresholds, the efficiency may vary.<sup>4</sup>\n",

Each row is an entity, and each column is a property; each position in the 2D array is a value for a specific property of a specific entity. Each column might stores different types of data; for example, one column might contain a name (data point that is commonly represented as a string) of a user and another might contain an age (data point that is commonly represented as an integer). Due to the different data types stored across columns, one can begin to understand the usefulness of pandas arrays in the context of 'heterogenous data.' \n",

The shallow copy operation also uses less time than a deep copy one because copying indices and data (and assigning references to them within the newly-created DataFrame object) takes more time than merely copying references to already existing indices and data in memory to the newly-created DataFrame object. Thirdly, one may wish to centralize the data such that changes made to any element in any of the DataFrames copied are made across all DataFrames; in essence, the DataFrames act as views to the same data.
