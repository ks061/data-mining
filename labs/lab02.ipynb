    "#### 30. [P] Write a function called ```test_normal_dist```. The purpose of this function is to evaluate the law of large numbers. It should have four parameters: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### ```mu``` = mean of distribution \n",
    "#### ```sd``` = standard deviation\n",
    "#### ```vec_length``` = length of the vector to generate randomly from a normal distribution, with mu and sd as parameters\n",
    "#### ```num_trials``` = number of times to repeat the experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The function should behave as follows. First, initialize the seed value to 1234, before your loop. Then, loop for ```num_trials```, generating ```vec_length``` numbers from a normal distribution. Compute the mean of that vector, then compute its deviation (absolute value of the observed mean - expected mean). This should be repeated for all trials, and then return the *average deviation* over all trials."
