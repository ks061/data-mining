Within this integrative experience, I intend to acquire, refine, and apply skills in data science and machine learning to understand patterns within data, including time-series/sequential data. \n",

    "With regards to applying these skills to a broader-scope project beyond this course, I have been working under the guidance of Professor King on designing a software toolkit that analyzes, and subsequently provides a visualization of, eye tracking data from experiments presenting a visual stimulus with an assortment of spatially-separated entities/objects to children with and without autism spectrum disorder. Prior to presenting a visualization of the eye tracking data, the data should utilize 'preprocessing and cleaning,' which is bolded as one of the fundamental topics of this course within the course syllabus, to then display a more clear visual. Afterwards, understanding trajectories in eye movement, sequence of objects focused upon, etc. requires a deep understanding of trajectory pattern mining, which the course material focused around pattern mining will expose me to important fundamentals for further learning about trajectory pattern mining, a more specialized pattern mining endeavor. Furthermore, the project involves defining areas of interest on the image stimulus exposed to the participants of the experiments through algorithm(s) within program(s) integrating clustering and machine learning. Due to the course covering clustering as one of the final stages of the course outlined in the syllabus, it will lend itself to the machine learning and clustering portion of this software toolkit and associated algorithm(s) design, which is planned to be wrapped into my capstone thesis at Bucknell. \n",

    "In conclusion, this advanced computer science elective in the field of data mining course is meaningful in providing me with a sphere of data science background and associated toolkits in the field of data mining. This acquired knowledge, then, can guide me further in my learning process and discovery within my gradually-found, specialized interest in the intersection of pattern mining and machine learning. "

    "numpy is a widely-adopted package in Python that contains a collection of methods and functions for \"scientific computing,\" particularly for computations that are mathematical or statistical. It emphasized object-orientedness through its central usage of multidimensional array objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary advantage of using this package is its providing a large range of data science methods and functions for those in other  Another advantage is that it further increases the already relatively high level of readability in Python. It does this by decreasing the number of lines of codes that programmers need to write due to its availability of a suite of methods and functions to manage the sets of data, for instance, contained in arrays. Also, numpy fixes the size of its arrays (changing the size of a numpy array would creating a new array in memory with the new size, copying the items from the old array into the new one, and deleting the old array from memory), increasing the predictability of the behavior of manipulations of the underlying numpy array. Similarly, numpy fixes the data type of items in a particular numpy array, in turn, fixing the the memory size assigned to each item in the array and, consequently, further increasing predictability. Finally, numpy contains the advantages of Python and C, adopting the simplicity and relatively high readability of Python while also adopting the efficient memory management and execution of mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, numpy has its own drawbacks. For one, because numpy arrays and objects are stored in contiguous blocks of memory, expanding or shrinking the size of an array requires allocating a new space in memory with respect to the new size of the array, copying the elements from the old array to the newly allocated array, and deallocating the old array, which is, in turn, overhead. In addition, there is ambiguity in dealing with undefined items in a numpy array, where NaN items assigned by numpy to undefined items are not the same as null; NaN items are not all equal because they are produced through different means (hence, they are represented by different float values), but they are given the same ID by Python, so one can verify a float as NaN by its id. Other platforms do not necessary use NaN (and instead resort to null, for instance, for undefined items); hence, compatibility across platforms when undefined items in an array are involved can be a potential issue. Finally, for someone who is only interested in doing simple array operations, learning and implementing numpy could be more overhead than needed for a light Python user.\n",
